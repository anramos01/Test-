        <!-- Introduction about myself -->
        <p>I am new to HTML and CSS and although it will be challenging, I am excited about learning it.
           I work as a field technician representative for a company that specializes in satellites,
           networking devices, and other types of electrical units. Despite having lots of
           hands-on experience through work, it doesn't make me an expert at all. Finally, I am back in school 
           to complete my BS in computer science. So far it's been great, and I am learning a lot; the experience
           has been very educational.</p>
        <!-- Course project description -->
        <p>I am excited to learn web development and explore how websites are built. In this course, I will study the fundamentals of website development and create a site as part of a project. My project will involve building a small business website focused on managing rental properties. This may be challenging since I usually associate rental properties with database management rather than websites. Although I work in the tech field, I also have a passion for real estate. Real estate involves numerous transactions and formulas, and a digital tool like this website can help others manage rental properties effectively.</p>
        <!-- Additional thoughts about investing -->
        <p>To anyone who thinks about investing whether it's in real estate, stock market, or anything that allows further growth, requires due diligence. This site will aim to help understand the complexities of getting involved with real estate and how to make your money grow throughout time. It's about time and patience, it's not about getting rich fast!</p>
