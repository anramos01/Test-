            <li>Passive real estate investing involves owning properties without having to manage them actively. It enables investors to generate income from real estate while avoiding the responsibilities of being a landlord, (Hayes, 2024).</li>
            <li>REI Nation is a reliable source and a huge competitor because it offers many examples and scenarios. They are a true passive real estate investing company. They buy distressed homes in average and above neighborhoods, renovate and sell to investors that are looking for passive income and to diversify their portfolio. It's a complete package, they can help with finding the mortgage lenders, lawyers, accounting, CPA'a and they are also the property management.

They also have a podcast <a href="https://biggerpockets.com/podcast">BiggerPockets</a> which is highly recommended for beginners to very experienced.
