        <!-- Introduction about myself -->
        <p>I am new to HTML and CSS and although it will be challenging, I am excited about learning it.
           I work as a field technician representative for a company that specializes in satellites,
           networking devices, and other types of electrical units. Despite having lots of
           hands-on experience through work, it doesn't make me an expert at all. Finally, I am back in school 
           to complete my BS in computer science. So far it's been great, and I am learning a lot; the experience
           has been very educational.</p>
        <!-- Course project description -->
        <p>My course project will consist of creating a small business website on how to
           manage a rental property business. This task may be somewhat challenging because  
           I associate rental properties more with a database-type structure rather than a website, 
           in relation to managing the investments.
           Although I work in the tech field and major in it, I also have a passion for real estate.
           I think real estate can involve tech because of all the transactions and formulas that
           take place. Also, in the world we live in now, we can access more tools due to the digital
           side of things. So, maybe a site like this can help someone understand how to manage a
           rental property.</p>
        <!-- Additional thoughts about investing -->
        <p>To anyone who thinks about investing whether it's in real estate, stock market, or anything that allows further growth, requires due diligence. This site will aim to help understand the complexities of getting involved with real estate and how to make your money grow throughout time. It's about time and patience, it's not about getting rich fast!</p>
